Revenue took a bit of a dip in December and recovered in January and is now growing. This is partly because of the [Apple Small Business Program](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/), which reduces the commission paid to them from 30% to 15%. I hope Google provides something simliar as half of the revenue comes from Android.

The slow growth is understandable as there was almost no development or marketing effort in December or January. I was taking a break to heal after an injury. In Feb, I've been back to about 30% of my normal speed. I'm not sure when I'll be able to go back to pre-December levels, but it's nice to be slowly getting better.

Overall there has been a **15.15%** increase in revenue since November.

## Steps Ahead

I've routinely underestimated how long it would take me to finish tasks, and it's taking me much longer to heal than I anticipated. Therefore, I would prefer to set milestones which I think are far more realistic.

### Development

I've created a small [task list](https://github.com/GitJournal/GitJournal/milestone/4) for March which I'm fairly confident I can accomplish. They also happen to be some of the most voted tasks. So please go ahead and vote on your favorite [issues](https://github.com/GitJournal/GitJournal/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc). It matters.

There is also a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/abBwyEK) where I share daily technical progress in the `#standup` channel.

### Marketing

Every couple of hours spent on marketing has a clear impact on revenue. I'm going to try at the minimum build a better icon and improve its [app](https://apps.apple.com/app/gitjournal/id1466519634) [pages](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.gitjournal.gitjournal&pcampaignid=website). A significant portion of new users come from searches in the app stores.

## What Niche?

My original plan for GitJournal was just a place to store my daily journal entries. I'd planned to create a separate app (maybe called GitNotes?) for most of my other note taking. However, GitJournal just kept growing and people started using it in all sort of ways which I had not expected (managing static websites).

Over the last year, with the explosion of Roam Research, Obsidian and other linked Note taking tools, the entire note taking space has been overturned. The difference between Journaling and Note Taking is now far fuzzier as different parts of them link to one another. Digital notes aren't like notes in a notebook.

GitJournal, as it currently exists, fits into this space as the mobile and tablet companion to the existing desktop apps. At some point, I might try and release a desktop and web-version, but for now it might be better to focus on the unique value provided by GitJournal.

Of course, none of this is set in stone.

title: GitJournal September Update
date: 2020-10-01
---

Last month, after much deliberation **I've decided to start working on GitJournal full-time**, till at least the end of the year. Before this I had been doing a mix of consulting and GitJournal.

Why did I decide to take such a big step? GitJournal's usage numbers have gone up, as has its revenue. It's still far away from covering my monthly expenses, but I think I can get there by the end of the year.

I've also taken another big decission - To be more open and transparent with the revenue and usage statistics. 

GitJournal has always been completely open source. But I never felt comfortable sharing the buisness side of things - This is mostly because of fear of failure and judgement. Building a product from scratch is difficult. And hopefully, by sharing the real numbers, it'll lead to more transparency, self-motivation and maybe even motivate other indie hackers out there. 

The GitJournal Project is a big experiment - An experiment to try and build a consumer facing fully open source product which is sustainable.

So, lets get to it.

For September my goals were to -

1. Launch on Hacker News
2. Reach 500â‚¬ in Revenue

As you can see from the numbers, I only reached 85% of the revenue goal. This is still a good increase from last month, but my target goal was on lower side.

Compared to the month of August, however this has resulted in an x% increase in Monthly Revenue and x% increase in MAU.

For a product to succeed, it has to have 3 parts -

1. Building something someone wants.
2. A well built product.
3. Getting the product in the hands of people who want it.

I think that GitJournal is genuinely filling a big hole in the market, and based on the users feedback they seem to use it for 3 possible things -

1. More Privacy Conscious Users storing their Notes
2. Developers storing their notes
3. New Age Note Taking Tools
4. Website builders



Goals for the month of October -

- Revenue: 750 euros
- Try to undrestand the retention problem

I have lots of features I want to implement in GitJournal, however, none of those are in my goal for this month - A scary part of starting something on your own is managing your feeling and figuring out how you work best - For me, the motivation to build GitJournal has not decreased over time. It's only gotten stronger. I know myself, and I hope to implement a number of features this month - Mutlti Git Repo Support, Theming, Graph View, and much much better Wiki Link Support.



What did I manage to accomplish in September?

- A website built on TailWindCSS - Talk about why this has helped. And how this was both a good and bad decission. - This can go into a completely separate blog post.
